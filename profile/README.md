## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the GitHub organization for two epigenetics labs at the University of Pennsylvania run by [Rajan Jain](https://www.med.upenn.edu/jainlab/) and [Eric Joyce](https://ericjoycelab.com/). The usual caveats apply to the public repositories hereâ€”unless otherwise noted, code here is still under development and should be used carefully as a starting point for your analyses.
